    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import binaryLoopOrder from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-base-binary-loop-interchange-order@deno/mod.js';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the deno branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/ndarray-base-binary-loop-interchange-order/tags). For example,

```javascript
import binaryLoopOrder from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-base-binary-loop-interchange-order@v0.1.0-deno/mod.js';
```

#### binaryLoopOrder( shape, stridesX, stridesY, stridesZ )

Reorders [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] dimensions and associated strides for [loop interchange][loop-interchange].

```javascript
// Define an array shape:
var shape = [ 2, 2 ];

// Define the strides for the input arrays:
var stridesX = [ 2, 1 ]; // row-major
var stridesY = [ 4, 2 ]; // row-major

// Define the strides for the output array:
var stridesZ = [ 1, 2 ]; // column-major

// Resolve the loop interchange order:
var o = binaryLoopOrder( shape, stridesX, stridesY, stridesZ );
// returns {...}
```

The function returns an object having the following properties:

-   **sh**: ordered dimensions.
-   **sx**: first input array strides sorted in loop order.
-   **sy**: second input array strides sorted in loop order.
-   **sz**: output array strides sorted in loop order.

For all returned arrays, the first element corresponds to the innermost loop, and the last element corresponds to the outermost loop.

## Notes

-   When iterating over the elements of a multi-dimensional array, accessing elements which are closer in memory can improve performance. To this end, [loop interchange][loop-interchange] is a technique used in [loop nest optimization][loop-nest-optimization] to improve locality of reference and take advantage of CPU cache.

    The purpose of this function is to order [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] dimensions according to the magnitude of array strides. By using the ordered dimensions and associated strides, one can construct nested loops (one for each dimension) such that the innermost loop iterates over the dimension in which array elements are closest in memory and the outermost loop iterates over the dimension in which array elements are farthest apart in memory. As a consequence, element iteration is optimized to minimize cache misses and ensure locality of reference.

-   Cache performance may be degraded if the layout order (i.e., row-major or column-major) differs for the input and output [ndarrays][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor]. This function is intended to optimize cache performance for the most common layout order. Accordingly, if the output [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] has a different layout order (e.g., if the input [ndarrays][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] are row-major and the output [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] is column-major), cache misses are likely for the output [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor]. In general, to ensure best performance, input and output [ndarrays][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] should have the same layout order.

-   The function assumes that the input and output [ndarrays][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] have the same shape. Hence, loop interchange order should only be determined **after** broadcasting.
